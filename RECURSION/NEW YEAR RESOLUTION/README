His 2024 resolution: Solve POTD every day.

Eager to earn coins for GFG Merchandise,
Geek faces new rules:

Earning Coin: 

Geek can accumulate coins[i] by solving the POTD on the ith day, where 1 <= coins[i] <= 2024 and the sum of coins <= 2024.
Merchandise Eligibility: To purchase merchandise, the coins earned must be divisible by 20 or 24, or precisely equal to 2024.
Geeks resolutions often fades over time. Realistically, he can only commit to active participation for N (where N â‰¤ 366) days.
Given the value of N and number of coins associated with each POTD, can Geek strategically solve some (or all) POTDs to become eligible for redeeming merchandise?
