PROBLEM STATETMENT:

Given a n x n matrix such that each of its cells contains some coins. 
Count the number of ways to collect exactly k coins while moving from top left corner of the matrix to the bottom right. 
From a cell (i, j), you can only move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).

Example 1:

Input:
k = 12, n = 3
arr[] = [[1, 2, 3], 
         [4, 6, 5], 
         [3, 2, 1]]
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
There are 2 possible paths with exactly 12 coins, (1 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 1) and (1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 1).
Example 2:

Input:
k = 16, n = 3
arr[] = [[1, 2, 3], 
       [4, 6, 5], 
       [9, 8, 7]]
Output: 
0 
Explanation: 
There are no possible paths that lead to sum=16
