                                                               PROBLEM STATEMENT

                      Given an array A of size N. The value of an array is denoted by the bit-wise XOR of all elements it contains. 
                                        Find the bit-wise XOR of the values of all subarrays of A.

                                                                   APPROACH 1

                                                      Calculate the count of subarrays:

  int count = (n - i) * (i + 1): 
                               This calculates the count of subarrays in which the current element at index i participates. 
                               The count is calc as the product of the remaining elements on the right (n-i) and the no. of elements on the left (i + 1).

                                                                   APPROACH 2
                        Just starting from 0th index take XOR of each alternate elemnts of the array.
