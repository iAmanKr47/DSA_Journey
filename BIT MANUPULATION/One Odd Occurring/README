Problem statement

Given an array ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ integers, where all the elements occur an even number of times and only one number occurs an odd number of times.
Find and return the number which occurs an odd number of times.

SOLUTION 
The bitwise Xor all elements of the array where even occurring elements on Xor will give 0 
whereas odd occurring element on xor give us the number since its even occurrence will give 0.

XOR(n appearing odd number of times) = n
XOR(n appearing even number of times) = 0
