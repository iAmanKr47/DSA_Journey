An array A[] of integers is given.

Lets define the power of the integer at index i. 
Let a be the minimum integer of all the integers having their indices less than i, and b be the minimum integer of all the integers having their indices greater than i 
The power of the integer at index i is defined as max (A[i]-a, A[i] - b).

The score of the A is defined as the maximum power of the powers of all the integers in the array. You need to print the Score of the A.

                                         Note

* 0-based indexing is followed.

* The integers can be positive, negative or 0.

* Take the powers of the integers at first and last index of the array to be -10^9.
