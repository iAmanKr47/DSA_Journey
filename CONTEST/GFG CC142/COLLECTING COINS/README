PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Geek has 2D Grid which contains N coins. Geek also knows the position of all the coins as he has 2D array Coins where X¡,Y¡ denote the position of the i ith Coin.
Geek can move in only one direction i.e Right, Left, Up, Down or Diagonal.
You need to find out the maximum number of coins Geek can collect if he can start moving from any point of the grid.

NOTE:
• Diagonal movement refers to movement from (i, j) to (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j- 1), (i-1, j+1), (i-1, j-1).
• The direction cannot be changed once Geek has started moving in a particular direction i.e if Geek is going right from (i, j) then he can only go right only.

                                                                    APPRAOCH

CASE:1 FOR SAME SAME ROW 
                         STORE ROW NO. OF EACH COIN and store occurance of a row no. who has max occurance 
CASE:2 FOR SAME SAME COL
                         STORE COL NO. OF each coin and store max occurance of a col no. who has max occurance 

CASE:3 FOR SAME MAIN DIAGONAL ELEMENT (ALL THOSE DIAGONAL WHICH STARTS FROM LEFT MOST TO RIGHT MOST)
                        PROPEERTY : FOR ELEMENT  IN SAME DAGONAL WE SHOULD HAVE SAME DIFFRENCE (ROW-COL) OF TWO ELEMENTS

                        STORE (ROW-COL) OF each coin and store max occurance of THAT who has max occurance OF (ROW-COL). 

CASE:4 FOR SAME SECONDARY  DIAGONAL ELEMENT (ALL THOSE DIAGONAL WHICH STARTS FROM RIGHT MOST TO LEFT MOST)
                         PROPEERTY : FOR ELEMENT  IN SAME SEC. DAGONAL WE SHOULD HAVE SAME VALUE OF SUM (ROW+COL) OF TWO ELEMENTS.

                         STORE (ROW-COL) OF each coin and store max occurance of THAT who has max occurance OF (ROW-COL).

FINAL ANS WOULD BE MAX OF ALL THE 4 CASES.
