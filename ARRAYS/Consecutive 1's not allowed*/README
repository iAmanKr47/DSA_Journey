Counting Binary Strings with No Consecutive 1's

Introduction: 
Binary strings are sequences of 0s and 1s, and an interesting problem arises when we seek to count all possible distinct binary strings of a given length 
such that there are no consecutive 1s. This problem has applications in various domains, 
including computer science and cryptography. In this article, 
we'll explore an optimized approach to solve this problem using the Fibonacci sequence andmodular arithmetic.

Intuition:
To count the number of binary strings with no consecutive 1s, we can leverage the Fibonacci sequence. 
The idea is to consider each bit in the string individually and calculate the number of possibilities for that bit. 
By doing so for every bit and combining the results, we can obtain the total count of valid binary strings.

Approach:
The optimized approach involves calculating the Fibonacci sequence up to the given length N. 
The Fibonacci numbers are used because they represent the number of ways to reach the current state from the previous two states,
which aligns with our problem of counting binary strings with no consecutive 1s.
