APPROACH:
         We can make use of a technique of storing 2 numbers inside one number.
         By doing this, when we modulo a number by mx, we get an original number. 
         When we divide by num, we get the desired number.
         Formula for storing two number inside one : 
         arr[i] = (arr[pos] % mx)* mx + (arr[i] % mx);
         pos is the position of a number which you want to place at the ith position.
         mx can be any number that is greater than all the elements of the array.



APPROACH 2 ALGO :
The entire code is just 3 for-loops:
1. Move b1 to bn/2 into their right positions
2. Move a3 to an/2 into their right positions
3. Get the correct element from the stored pair in each position


#BOTH ARE SIMILAR APPROACH
