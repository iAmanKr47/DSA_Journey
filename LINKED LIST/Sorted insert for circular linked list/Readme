PROBLEM STATEMENT:
              Given a sorted circular linked list of length n, the task is to insert a new node in this circular list so that it remains a sorted circular linked list.

                                                               KEEP IN MIND:

input : 
n = 6
-15 -9 -6 5 7 14 

-19
Your Output:   Output Limit Exceeded

Its Correct output is:
-19 -15 -9 -6 5 7 14

it is because it is circular linked list and most of you are connecting head directly in this case :-
if(data < head->data){
 
Node * temp = new Node(data);
temp->next = head;
return temp;
}
 
but understand if head is -15 and 14is tail then 14 will again connect to -15 in ( temp -> next = head ) as well. So,
1. create new Node (for ex. temp)
2. create new Node (for ex. curr) for traversal till end node and then connect the end node's next to temp and temp's next to head
