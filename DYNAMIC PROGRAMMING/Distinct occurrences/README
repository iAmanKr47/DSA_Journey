Given two strings s and t of length n and m respectively. Find the count of distinct occurrences of t in s as a sub-sequence modulo 1e9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "banana" , t = "ban"
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
There are 3 sub-sequences:[ban], [ba n], [b an].
Example 2:

Input:
s = "geeksforgeeks" , t = "ge"
