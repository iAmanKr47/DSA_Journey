CODE 1: SIMPLY INCREASE SUM BY GREATER NUMBER ,AND CHECK AT ANY MOMENT IF SUM IS DIVISIBLE BY SMALLER NUMBER THEN SUM IS THE LCM OF TWO NUMBERS

long long firstContact(int n, int m) {
        long long greater=max(n,m);
        long long  smallest=min(n,m);
        long long ans;
        long long i=greater;
        while(1)
        {
            if(i%smallest==0)
            {
               ans=i;
               break;
            }
            i+=greater;
        }
        return ans;
    }


CODE2: USING GCD
 
Implementation
First calculate the GCD of n and m with the builtin functions.
Then As we know there is a relation between LCM and GCD, I,e: n*m = LCM*GCD of these numbers
So we can easily find the value of LCM using these equation.

class Solution {
  public:
    long long firstContact(int n, int m) {
        long long ans = m / __gcd(n, m);
        ans *= n;
        return ans;
    }
};
